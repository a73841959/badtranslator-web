    howItWorksQuote: "The Chinese will talk to you (English Commonwealth) or telephone (North American English) is a popular international children's game in which the players form the line, the first player comes with a message and the other person in a row was a crocodile.\
      The third player repeats another player's message. When the last player is added, they report a message they have heard about the entire team.\
      The first person then compares the original message with the final version. While this message is moving forward and part of joy, it ends naturally.\
      Errors usually go to \"reel\", so the announcement the last player published is very different from the first player, usually or effect.\
      The reason for change is the inability to understand the cause of depression or intolerance, irregular corrections and silence.\
      <br />This game is often a party game or a game for children. It is often a metaphor for a growing error, especially rumours or rumours, or at all, a lack of reliability of human memory or oral tradition.",
